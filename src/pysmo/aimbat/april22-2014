These look a lot better. Lets stick with plain Euclidean for the spatial clustering. There is no visible benefit from the standardized euclidean here. Could you send the other Rand index scatter plot as well, but without the max variance (so 6 points instead of 9)? Also the symbology needs better explaining in that figure. perhaps a legend instead of the messy text? I think from now on we stick with avg and total variance. I would still like to see the number of clusters reduced for total variance (just do Euclidean) to see whether there is a lower best number of clusters in that case.

Friday unfortunately I am heading to a conference in the late afternoon, so wont be in on campus. However, I would be happy to skype. We are at the stage with this that I'd like to start writing up a draft. Before we get there, I'd like to send to Dave Ramsey the main results of spatial clustering and PCA. So perhaps on Friday you could put together figures that summarize results? I think I have all we need here except for 1. extended cluster parameter space for total variance and 2. rand index plot demonstrating the uniqueness of our different distance metrics. 3. A PC biplot figure colored by latitude (I dont think we tried this one yet?)

From my point of view, the last piece we need is to cluster on the 4 pcs - but perhaps we should discuss how best to do this on Friday. I will guess that standardized euclidean will be necessary here, and it is possible that have 4 variables instead of 2 (for the spatial clustering) will make your dense algorithm very slow. Its worth maybe trying with one set of spectral clustering parameters as an experiment... this step may take some experimentation, but will be a nice way to tie together the two things that you've done.
